# Recommended Design Tools

This document lists design tools that I personally use and recommend to other developers.

- [Diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) - for creating and maintaining project design diagrams.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - for creating design wireframes, markups, and mockups.
