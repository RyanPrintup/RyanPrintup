# Recommended Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

This document lists IDEs  that I personal use and recommend to other developers.

- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - for basically everything.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - for heavy duty design such as application development.
